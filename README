I used npm as dependency management tool and webpack fo r.

exec this command from local terminal on main folder "d3js"

- npm install
install the npm dependecy if required

- npm run start
webpack will compile the code and server run on http://localhost:4800/


open the browser page at http://localhost:4800/

src/app.js will open the  index.html with carousel

static_index.html contains the charts without carousel, for test it  you should rename it as index.html
